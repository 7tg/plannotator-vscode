Opens [Plannotator](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator) plan reviews inside VS Code tabs instead of an external browser.

## Features

- Automatically intercepts Plannotator browser opens and displays them in a VS Code panel
- Persists your Plannotator settings (identity, permissions, editor preferences) across sessions
- Auto-closes the panel when you approve or send feedback on a plan
- Works with Claude Code running in VS Code's integrated terminal
- Works with Claude Code as a VS Code extension
- Configurable via VS Code settings
- Manual URL opening via command palette

## How It Works

When Plannotator opens a browser to show a plan review, this extension intercepts the request and opens it in a VS Code panel instead.

### For Claude Code in Integrated Terminal:

1. The extension injects a `PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER` environment variable into integrated terminals
2. When Plannotator opens a URL, the bundled router script sends it to the extension via a local HTTP server
3. The extension opens the URL in a custom WebviewPanel with an embedded iframe

### For Claude Code as VS Code Extension:

1. The extension registers an external URI opener for HTTP/HTTPS URLs
2. When Claude Code (or any extension) tries to open a Plannotator URL via `vscode.env.openExternal()`, the opener intercepts it
3. If the URL contains "plannotator", it opens in a VS Code panel instead of an external browser

### Cookie Persistence:

A local reverse proxy handles cookie persistence (VS Code webview iframes don't support cookies natively) — settings are stored in VS Code's global state and restored transparently across sessions.

## Requirements

- [Plannotator](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator) installed
- VS Code 1.85.0+

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `plannotatorWebview.injectBrowser` | `true` | Inject PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER env var into integrated terminals |

## Commands

- **Plannotator: Open URL** — Manually open a Plannotator URL in a panel

## Troubleshooting

### URL opens in external browser instead of VS Code
- Ensure `plannotatorWebview.injectBrowser` is enabled
- Open a **new** terminal after installing the extension (existing terminals won't have the env var)

### Panel shows a blank page
- Check if Plannotator's server is still running
- Some network configurations may block localhost access from the webview
